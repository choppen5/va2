1. Deal with the handle leak in VA2 
2. When a TCP/iP error happens, what happens with collection?
- seems like there an hour long gap at least)

3. When a srvrmgr is shut down, what happens to srvrmgr ? (eventually it restarts)
- we know it is an error in collection cycle, but still try to parse it (with no results probably)
- Instead, upon error in collection cycle, lets restart ?

- option for starting and running srvrmgr every time?
(create input file0
(open server manager with the output?)
(run and complete)


4. Fix the handle leak on vsrvmgr... how to do it?
- test current code, check handle count


5. Operations that shut down srvrmgr:
- open it, send commands, close it
(if value is set, open and close server manager every time)


( line 206 - do an if (do not start session0
208 )


(line 278 - 280 ) use an if case

line 327: refe (sends an exit now - do an if statement here)
line 556: refe - close session, do an if here

601: 609 - start a session



(line 673 - 639) use an if case

look for: 
- refe (refrence to the siebel server)
- stopandrestartsrvrmgrsession (find out where this is called)
