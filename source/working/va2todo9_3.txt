
1. compile new versions with changes and vnumbers
2. package, zip, ftp
3. create zip file for changed exes for France
4. respond to email
5. contact portugal and tell them about the fix

- updated the versions on the website
- write blog posting about the new version


1. reactions are sent in from LSM
2. There are multiple reactions
3. When the VLSM starts up it tries to execute reaction
- fix:  Only allow one reaction (id per host?) on insert...
- or, delete reactions of the same type after executing

-- get sql statement to check if rule is there (look at sql)
-- write if statement, return sql to see if it is there



- (check the reaction insert code....) may work... 
- VA2 harvester, change procdeure if there is a reaction for a command don't wait for response
(don't know about this...)



Issue: if there are many reactions stored up for a server, when the server restarts it will execute
the reaction over and over.


workplan:
change vadmin21::sendsysmsg
- do a query on reaction_id, $sv_name, $host 
- do not insert if matches.



Issue:
- When sending a reaction to a siebel server, VA2 waits to parse the output. There is no
response.

- potential fix - do not wait for output of reaction commands
 - requires deep code changes...


Issue: 
NT Services are not monitored if no Siebel Server and LSM is installed on the machine


Issue:
--  Reactions are not fired unless a VA2 Siebel server is running on it?
	--  move code to VLSM process (only non Siebel server ones)
	-- move getnex to vlsm service
		- find out the NT Service checking, could be the same area as bat file


todo:  add polling interval to the vlsm
add check_services and next 
- or, change vsrvrmgr so it accepts no parameters for start up
-- if no Siebel server is passed in, only execute the ntservice and reaction code

-- change the startup vlsm so it starts vsrvmgr with appserver names, or no name if there are no servers on that host



- line 44 - create no variable
- line 56, change to accept no parameters if so
- line 184, do an if statement to see if we are running as a siebel server or not
- down to lines 207 
- move variables
- lines 236, before if &checksiebsrvr(), add Siebel server check
- else, only do 
	&check_services;
	&getnex;



Vlsm changes:
1. create new variable on  
2. change arguments -  port first, second appserver, third instance



Other issues:
- question about web services:
 - here is the requirement:  The log into windows who opens MMC must have administrative access
 to the target computer, for example:

MMC is running on local pc, logged as Admin1 to windows.
Web Server is on MHIS66TGTPRDW1 
Admin1 has administrative control of MHIS66TGTPRDW1 
The host is filled out for the Web server
When host is filled out and present, opening the Services tab on the software element should show the
nt services running on that host, in this example MHIS66....




The LSM must be installed on that service and have an ODBC connection VA2.  Then you can test by 
stopping the service, and check weather events or restarts are generated.


3/About global reactivity:


There are different scenarios were events and reactions will be processed.  There is also generally the time
that an Event is generated, and in some cases a Reaction, which is the response to the event.

Here are some examples:

-- Shut down a service VA2 is monitoring
	-- Event generation time
		- stopping a service, such as Siebel service, may take a minute or two (depending on env)
		- VA2 LSM will check the service status according to the Poll interval
		- event generation will happen at the Poll interval
		- Default Poll interval is 30 seconds.		
		- Event generation will happen.  According to the settings, VA2 may try restarting.  
	-- Reaction time 
		- Executed with poll interval on the central server


-- Log event error:
	- Event Generation:
		- real time, the error in the log should generate an event immediatly
	- Reaction
		- Executed with poll interval on the central server


-- Siebel Component failure:
	- Event Generation:
		LSM:
		- Siebel component status is harvested at the poll interval 
		- Plus harvest time for component status.  
		- Harvest time depends on how many Siebel tasks, components, etc running for that server
		- After components and task status is collected, compared against Notification rules
		VA2 Central Server
		- At Poll Interval, the VA2 Central server executes Analysis rules
		- The particular Analysis Rule timing may execute (1 minute to 1 week) to check component status for example
		- Event generated as result of the Analysis Rule
	- Reaction
		- Fired in response to the Analysis Rule generating an event

4/ About regular perl expression in search string: 
	- (give an example of this)


5/About some functions: 
	- try this (need to send the patch)

6/ What is the difference from Purge Processed Events and Purge All Events ?   
- There is a Processed flag that gets set when an Event is emailed.  The clear all processed deletes already emailed
events.  Clear all events deletes all events.




- issue: addding new component, does not go into effect unless LSM is restarted?
- Mon Sep  3 11:00:56 2007: RECIEVED A RESTART MESSAGE.  MUST RESTART LSM TO MONITOR FOR ERROR
